Unix-Shell
==========
This is a simple Unix shell school project I did in the third year, in which I implemented following things:
  1. a shell interface
  2. execution of built-in commands and external programs under the shell
  3. handling pipe and redirection under the shell
  4. handling job controls (switch jobs between foreground and background) under the shell

Specification

1. Introduction

  (1). When first running the program, it shows the current directory and waits for input, like this:
      [OS shell:/home/some_directory]$
  
  (2). The input command line is a character string. The OS shell should read in the input command line
      from the standard input stream (stdin in C) of the OS shell.

    Note: 
    
        assume that:
        
          1. An input command line has a maximum length of 255 characters.
          2. An input command line ends with a carriage return character ’\n’.
          3. There is neither leading nor trailing space characters in the input command line.
          4. A token is a series of characters without any space characters. Each token (or word) in the
            input command line is separated by at least one space character.
2. Internal commands

The OS Shell should support the following internal commands:

· Any other build-in commands, e.g., ls, mkdir, who, whoami, cp, mv, rm, rmdir, cal,
  chmod, pwd, etc, where I do not list all the commands, which does not mean that the OS shell
  can not process them. In fact, the OS shell should support most commands.
  
· cd: changes the current working directory to the directory supplied as argument. If there is no
  argument, you should print an error message.
  
· status: this command should print the status of the last command executed. Commands return
  0 as the indication of success, and any non-zero value to indicate the failure.
  
· history: The OS shell needs to record all the historical commands that have been executed
  before.
  
· exit: leaves the shell.

· Note that the OS shell should be able to resolve the parameters of these commands as well. For
  example, ls –al.
  
· External Programs: The OS shell should be able to execute any other external programs as well. For example, an
  executable program “hello” generated by gcc compiler can run in the OS shell correctly, e.g.,
  your run “./hello” in the OS shell.
